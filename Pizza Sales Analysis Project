Pizza Sales Analysis Project
This project involves analyzing pizza sales data to uncover key insights and identify the main revenue drivers for a pizza business. Using SQL in MySQL Workbench,
I performed data analysis on pizza sales to understand trends and patterns, with the goal of optimizing the menu offerings and enhancing overall sales performance.

Overview
The Pizza Sales Analysis Project aims to provide actionable insights by analyzing pizza sales data. 
By examining various metrics such as the popularity of different pizza types and sizes, revenue generation, and sales trends, 
this analysis helps pizza businesses optimize their menu offerings and improve sales strategies.
Through this project, I was able to analyze sales performance and identify which menu items contribute the most to revenue. 
The goal was to deliver insights that could inform decisions on product offerings, pricing, and promotional strategies.

Key Metrics
Here are some of the key metrics I focused on during the analysis:
Most Popular Pizza Types and Sizes: Identified which pizza types (e.g., Margherita, Pepperoni, Veggie) and sizes (e.g., small, medium, large) are the most frequently ordered.
Total Revenue: Calculated the total revenue generated from pizza sales, as well as revenue by product type.
Top Revenue-Generating Items: Identified the highest revenue-generating pizzas, including those that performed better during specific days or seasons.

Technologies Used
SQL: Used SQL for data analysis, performing queries to extract, aggregate, and analyze the pizza sales data.
MySQL Workbench: Used as the database management system to run SQL queries and analyze data.
Excel: The initial dataset was in Excel format, which was then imported into MySQL Workbench for analysis.

Installation
To run this project and use the SQL queries on your own dataset:

Step 1: Download datasets or download zip file 
Step 2: Set up MySQL Workbench
Download and install MySQL Workbench.

Open MySQL Workbench and create a new database (schema) to store the pizza sales data.

Step 3: Import Data from Excel into MySQL Workbench
Prepare your Excel file: Ensure the Excel file is structured with columns corresponding to the fields in the dataset (Order ID, Pizza Type, Size, Quantity Sold, Price, Order Date, and Revenue).

Save your Excel file as a CSV: In Excel, go to File > Save As, and choose the CSV format.

Import CSV into MySQL Workbench:

Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL instance.
Select the Schema (database) you want to import the data into.
Go to the Table Data Import Wizard (right-click on the schema, choose Table Data Import Wizard).
Choose the CSV file you saved earlier.
Follow the steps to map the CSV columns to the table columns in MySQL.
Once completed, the data will be imported into your MySQL database.
Step 4: Run the SQL Queries
Once the data is imported, use the SQL Editor in MySQL Workbench to run the queries provided in the SQL Queries section above.

Analyze the output of each query to get insights into pizza sales trends and revenue drivers.

Usage
After setting up the database and importing the data, open MySQL Workbench.
Execute the SQL queries in the SQL Editor to analyze the data and extract insights.
Use the results to inform your business decisions related to menu optimization, pricing, and sales strategy.
